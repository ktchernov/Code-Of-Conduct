* We have zero tolerance for abuse, harassment, or discrimination.
* We respect people’s boundaries and identities.
* We refrain from using language that can be considered oppressive (systemically or otherwise), eg. sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, classist, etc. - this includes (but is not limited to) various slurs.

**These things are NOT OK.**

### If you say something that is found offensive, and you are called out on it, let’s:

* Listen without interruption.
* Believe what the person is saying & do not attempt to disqualify what they have to say.
* Ask for tips / help with avoiding making the offense in the future.
* Apologize and ask forgiveness.

Failing to follow the community guidelines as described in this document carries consequences. For minor infractions, you may be temporarily suspended from the Slack. Upon repeat offenses, or if the community believes you are not acting in good faith, you may be asked to leave permanently.

### Privacy
* All conversations are private unless otherwise specified. 
* If you wish to share a conversation, or part of one, you must get permission from each person involved.

### Best Practices
* Stay on topic. The goal of the Android NZ Slack is to facilitate discussion of things relating to Android development. This could be about marketing, business, server-side programming, or other things that may be important to an Android developer. For off-topic topics go to #random
* If you have a technical question, please try and figure it out before posting here. If you're having trouble, all questions are welcome.
* Before asking any questions, please check if there's a channel for it before asking in #android-general
* Job posting can be posted in #hiring only. Do not reach out to individuals for hiring purposes.

## Slack Etiquette

### Slack Commands

Many members of Android NZ have this Slack open during the work day, or installed on their phones. Additionally, there are members in many different time zones. Please be cautious about using  `@channel` or `@everyone` and avoid it if possible.

For tips and tricks or questions about Slack usage, check out #meta.

### Q & A

Value your fellow members' time, and be considerate when asking questions. Before asking a question, please Google for it, and consult the Android documentation. If it is still unclear, please reference the sources you consulted in your question.

When answering questions, avoid condescending language or impatience. We are all trying our hardest!
